Surface tension can cause a liquid column to breakup into droplets. This is known as the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. Some pictures of this phenomena as captured by Milton Van Dyke in his famous Album of Fluid Motion are shown below

We further developed these studies on the stable and unstable oscillations of liquid columns to establish an intricate picture of instabilities in a liquid column. We study the response of the column to three kinds of perturbations (shown in the image below) and establish the conditions for stability in each of these cases.

The study of these configurations leads us to a cusp catastrophe - a phenomena that characterizes sudden change due to the presence of hysteresis in a system. The next figure shows a typical cusp catastrophe surface on the left (figure taken from Zeeman, E. Christopher. "Catastrophe theory." Scientific American 234.4 (1976): 65-83.) and the catastophe observed in liquid column instabilities on the right

We is the Weber number which denotes the strength of rotation relative to surface tension, k is the axial wavenumber and sigma is the growth rate of disturbances. The system is stable within the island and _maybe_ unstable outside.

We then compare the role of surface tension in liquid jets to that of gravity in stellar gas clouds and find susprisingly similar results.
