Viscosity of liquids varies significantly with temperature, altering key features in turbulent flows. Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of such flows, however,
can be prohibitively expensive, spanning weeks on supercomputing clusters. We are using reduced order models and analytical methods to efficiently compute statistics in 
wall-bounded viscosity-stratified turbulence. 

The effects of viscosity stratification can be peculiar. The image below shows that there is an excess of turbulent kinetic energy near the more viscous side of the channel relative to the less viscous side.
