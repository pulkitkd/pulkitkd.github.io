Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are an accurate but expensive method of simulating fluid flows. Their cost often precludes their use in many engineering applications. Data-driven technologies, on the other hand, can be much faster but struggle to maintain their accuracy while simulating chaotic systems. In this work we first train Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) using simulation data and then use FNO in tandem with DNS to achieve accurate simulations at nearly half the computational cost.
