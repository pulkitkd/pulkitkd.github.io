Solutions of anisotropic (or non-spherical) particles can exhibit interesting properties based on the orientation of solute particles. In this work, we study the conditions under which various orientation states can be achieved by a solute particle.

    Our setup consists of a spheroidal particle suspended in linear flow. The aspect ratio, fluid inertia, particle inertia and the flow type are the relevant parameters.
</div>


We obtain interesting trajectory patterns for the spheroids and the conditions under which certain orientations can be achieved.
